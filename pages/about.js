                <p className = {styles.paragraph}>This tool provides a convenient alternative to the
                    OWASP SAMM Toolkit (Excel workbook) for capturing your SAMM assessment responses.
                     Leveraging several open-source JavaScript frameworks, the SAMMwise application 
                     provides an intuitive, page-oriented workflow for completing a SAMM assessment, 
                     coupled with dynamic graphics to visualize assessment results.
                    </p>
